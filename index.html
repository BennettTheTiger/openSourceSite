			<h4>Angular.js</h4>
			<p>HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.</p>

		<h4>Who writes this code anyways?</h4>
		<p>The open source initiative is a global non-profit, The Open Source Initiative (OSI) protects and promotes open source software, development and communities, championing software freedom in society through education, collaboration, and infrastructure, stewarding the open source definition, and preventing abuse of the ideals and ethics inherent to the open source movement.</p>

		<h2 id="section3title">Licencing Open Source</h2>
		<h3>How is intellectual property protected?</h3>
		<h4 id="section4details"> While there are over 50 different open source licensing options, here are the 3 most common. </h4>
		<div class="col-sm-4">
			<hr>
			<div class="circle logos img-responsive center-block">1</div>
			<h3>Free-For-All</h3>
			<p> This licence only requires the licensees to give credit to the original authors. Derivative works can be made proprietary. These licenses are sometimes referred to as “academic licenses”. Free-for-all licenses don’t require authors to share code, which means a competitor can “take” the code and build a improved version of it </p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-4">
		<hr>
			<div class="circle logos img-responsive center-block">2</div>
			<h3>Keep-Open</h3>
			<p>In this case the final software has to be made available as open source. Meaning if you use other peoples code that was open source. You cant claim it as you own even though it contributes to your overall program.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="col-sm-4">
		<hr>
			<div class="circle logos img-responsive center-block">3</div>
			<h3>Share-Alike</h3>
			<p>If the existing software is modified or extended, the result as a whole has to be made available as open source.The term copyleft is more commonly used to characterize this kind of license.</p>

		<div class="col-xs-12"><h2 id="section5title">Why use Open Source?</h2></div>
		<br>
		<div class="col-sm-3" id="box1">
			<h3>Control</h3>
			<p>Open source lets developers look under the hood and see what the code is actually doing. It gives them complete control and allows them to only enable or disable certain features.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-3" id="box2">
			<h3>Education</h3>
			<p>Open source gives stumped developers a glimpse at how other developers solve problems. Open source allows them to pick through the code and find things that could be useful.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-3" id="box3">
			<h3>Stability</h3>
			<p>Many people prefer open source software to proprietary software for important, long-term projects. Because programmers publicly distribute the source code, users relying on that software for critical tasks can be sure their tools won't disappear or fall into disrepair if their original creators stop working on them.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-3" id="box4">
			<h3>Security</h3>
			<p>Many people prefer the security of open source software. The user can see exactly what the program is doing and confirm only the necessary tasks are being performed.</p>
